## Overview

The **MPhil/PhD Lifecycle Management System** is a role-based academic operations platform built to manage the full postgraduate research journey in one system.

It is not only a student portal. It combines:

- a public-facing admissions portal
- a role-based internal dashboard
- a postgraduate workflow management system
- a document submission and review platform
- an administrative coordination layer for supervisors, examiners, and programme staff

The core idea is to move the postgraduate lifecycle away from fragmented forms, email chains, and disconnected document handling into one secure, role-aware platform with shared validation, workflow tracking, and lifecycle visibility.

---

## What The System Covers

The platform supports the complete postgraduate lifecycle, including:

- public programme applications
- admissions and onboarding
- registration and renewal tracking
- proposal submission and review
- progress report submission and supervisor sign-off
- thesis submission and versioning
- viva scheduling and outcome recording
- correction upload and approval
- final archival and administrative oversight

A typical lifecycle flow is:

1. A public applicant submits an application.
2. Administrators review the application and intake status.
3. Once admitted, the applicant becomes a student in the research lifecycle.
4. The student submits proposals, progress reports, thesis documents, and corrections.
5. Supervisors evaluate and sign off academic work.
6. Examiners and administrators manage viva and thesis workflows.
7. Corrections are submitted, reviewed, and approved.
8. Final records are archived for long-term administrative reference.

---

## Frontend Structure

The application has two main user-facing areas.

### Public Pages

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page |
| `/apply` | Public application form |
| `/apply/success` | Application submission success page |
| `/login` | Sign-in page |

### Dashboard Pages

Role-based dashboards live under `/dashboard`, including:

- `/dashboard/student`
- `/dashboard/supervisor`
- `/dashboard/examiner`
- `/dashboard/admin`

The shared dashboard shell is located at:

```text
src/components/dashboard/dashboard-role-layout.tsx
```

This layout controls:

- sidebar navigation
- active route styling
- dashboard framing
- shared typography and page structure

Because all role dashboards flow through this shell, many dashboard-wide UI changes can be applied centrally.

---

## API Overview

Backend logic lives under:

```text
src/app/api
```

## Data And Validation

The database schema is defined in:

```text
prisma/schema.prisma
```

The codebase is centered around a lifecycle-oriented model that includes:

- users
- students
- supervisors
- examiners
- administrators
- applications
- registrations
- research proposals
- evaluation forms
- progress reports
- review panels
- theses
- thesis examiner assignments
- vivas
- correction documents
- documents
- notifications
- notification logs

Validation is handled primarily with **Zod** so that client-side and server-side rules stay aligned across workflows such as:

- login
- public applications
- proposals
- proposal evaluations
- progress reports
- theses
- corrections
- viva scheduling

---
